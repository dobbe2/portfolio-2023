Hello! My name is James Dobbe, and I enjoy building websites and designing for new and growing businesses. My interest in front-end web development is fueled by a mix of artistic and logical perspectives that get enjoyment from building both interesting and engaging pages and components. 

I've worked for a large crypto firm, helping to build and implement a complete redesign of a handful of applications for active users. Projects include an NFT marketplace and a voting/ballot monitoring app.

I have also worked with businesses to build modern websites that are designed to help drive more traffic and engage their users.

Hello! My name is James Dobbe and I enjoy building websites and designing for new and growing businesses. My intrest in front end web development is fueled by a mix of artistic and logical path that gets enjoyment from building both interesting and beautiful pages and components. 

I've worked for a Large Cryto firm helping to build and implement a complete redesign of a handful of applications for actuive users, including an NFT marketplace, and a Voting/Ballot monitoring app.

I have also worked with businesses to build modern websites that are designed to help drive more traffic and engage their users.
